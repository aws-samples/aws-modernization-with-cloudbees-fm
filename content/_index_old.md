# CloudBees Feature Management Workshop

### Welcome

Put simply, feature flagging is a practice of wrapping new functionality in conditional code blocks.

Feature flags are used to hide, enable or disable features during runtime. With feature flags, a software feature can be tested even before it is completed and ready for release. For example, during the development process, a developer can enable the feature for local testing and disable it for all other users. Feature flagging also provides an alternative to maintaining multiple feature branches in source code.
