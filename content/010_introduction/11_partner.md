# At a Glance

[CloudBees](https://www.cloudbees.com/), the enterprise software delivery company, provides the industry’s leading DevOps technology platform. CloudBees enables developers to focus on what they do best: Build stuff that matters, while providing peace of mind to management with powerful risk mitigation, compliance and governance tools.

## CloudBees Feature Management Overview 

[CloudBees Feature Management](https://www.cloudbees.com/products/feature-management) is an enterprise-ready feature flag management solution with robust deployment rules, audience segmentation and a testing framework for controlling which audiences are exposed to what features. With CloudBees Feature Management, you can rollout and rollback features, test and target features for specific customer segments for fast feedback and use gradual rollout and rollback capabilities to sidestep the danger of “big bang” or “big bust” deployments. CloudBees Feature Management speeds the pace of development by enabling the delivery of software changes as soon as they are code complete or even for testing a minimum viable product (MVP) within a subset of internal or external users.
