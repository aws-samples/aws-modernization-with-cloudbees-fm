# Learning Objectives
Today we are going to learn the following topics:

- How developers can use feature flags to decouple deployments from releases.
- How product teams can employ testing in production and experience improved feedback loops.
- How team members can leverage GitOps to seamlessly synchronize states of feature flags and have an improved audit trail stored in their SCM.
