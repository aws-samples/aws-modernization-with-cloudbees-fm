# Self-Paced Workshop

Welcome to the Self Guided Setup section. Here is a preview of what we will be setting up:

* (Optional) Sign up for CloudBees Feature Management free trial
* Setup GitHub account
* Setup GitHub Organization
* Install CloudBees Feature Management Workshop GitHub App

Note: While it's possible to replicate the entire setup in your own AWS account, for your convenience to complete the lab, we will use CloudBees CI managed controller.
